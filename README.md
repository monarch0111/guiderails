# About

I wanted to create a resource on Rails generators that was more comprehensive and interactive than
a cheatsheet. A GUI makes required arguments obvious, and exposes some lesser known options (e.g. `{polymorphic}`).

# Development

Some VSCode debug configurations are provided in `.vscode`. I'm not sure why breakpoints don't seem to work very well, but adding a `debugger` expression works.

The project runs on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and was built with `yarn`.
